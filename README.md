# COMP551---FinalProject
This project investigates the performance of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to classify image data from the Fashion-Mnist dataset [2]. Furthermore, brief experiments with convolutional neural will be carried out. Hyperametrization was carried out on the learning rate, the L2 weight and the depth of the MPL model.
